# Contributing to [webwire-go](https://github.com/qbeon/webwire-go)

There are many ways to contribute to the project:
- **Reporting bugs** (ideally with solution proposals)
- **Proposing missing features** (ideally with solution proposals)
- **Identifying performance bottlenecks** (ideally with fixes).
- **Providing performance comparisons** to alternative solutions
	(such as comparing common properties like req/s, latency and throughput
	with the [standard HTTP library](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/)
	or third-party solutions such as [valyala/fasthttp](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp)).
- **Reviewing and improving the [documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/qbeon/webwire-go)**
	as well as additional documentation materials.
- **Adding or proposing missing examples** to make the library easier to get started with.
- **Reviewing code** to improve code quality.
- **Spreading the word** to make more developer aware of the library and its features.


## Contribution Guidelines

### Reporting Issues
If you identify a reproducible problem in the library, unclear or missing documentation or a missing feature
then please feel free to post a new issue in the [issues section](https://github.com/qbeon/webwire-go/issues)
following the [guidelines](#writing-good-bug-reports-and-feature-requests).

Before you create a new issue, please ensure there are no similar
[open](https://github.com/qbeon/webwire-go/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+)
or [closed](https://github.com/qbeon/webwire-go/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+) issues.
If you find your issue already exists, feel free to make relevant comments and add your reactions.
Please use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:
- üëç for up vote
- üëé for down vote
- üòï for confusion
- üéâ for celebration

Once submitted, your report will be marked with relevant tags by core repository maintainers as soon as possible.
When a maintainer begins working on your issue - the issue will be assigned to him/her.

Your issue may also be scheduled to certain [milestones](https://github.com/qbeon/webwire-go/milestones)
in the process of its resolution.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests
- File a single issue per problem and feature request.
- Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.
- Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input.
	 Many issues look similar, but have different causes.
- Provide as much information as you can to increase the likeliness
	of someone successfully reproducing the issue and elaborating a fix.
- Use one of the [available forms](https://github.com/qbeon/webwire-go/issues/new/choose) that suit your issue best
	- Remove optional form fields when not filled out
	- Use the [generic form](https://github.com/qbeon/webwire-go/issues/new?template=generic-issue.md) only in case no other form suits your issue
- Provide either a code snippet that demonstrates the issue or a link to a code repository
	the developers can easily pull down to recreate the issue locally.
- Use [markdown formatting](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
	and [code blocks](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code-and-syntax-highlighting)
	to improve readability.

If the developers can't reproduce the issue right away they will ask for more information in the comments section.

### Posting Pull Requests
Please consider discussing your changes in an issue before submitting any pull requests!
Submit pull requests that are not attached to any issue only in those cases,
where an issue would be an obvious, unnecessary overhead.

To enable the core maintainers to quickly review and accept your pull requests,
please ensure that the following requirements are met:
- Create only one pull request per issue.
- Link the related issue.
- Never merge multiple requests in one unless they have the same root cause.
- Avoid introducing new external dependencies as much as possible.
- Keep the changes as small as possible.
- Don't mix cosmetic and behavioral code changes!
- Provide cosmetic code changes in separate requests and denote them as such.
- Add tests if existing tests don't cover the new code.
- Properly document your changes by providing a description about **what** and **why** was changed,
	even if the answers to these questions seem obvious to you.
- Properly document the changed code parts.
- Ensure code quality:
	- Ensure that the tests pass with `GOCACHE=off go test -race ./...`
	- Ensure that [go vet](https://golang.org/cmd/vet/) passes with `go vet ./...`
	- Ensure that [megacheck](https://github.com/dominikh/go-tools/tree/master/cmd/megacheck)
		passes with `megacheck ./...`
- Make sure you're following the [conventions](#conventions).
